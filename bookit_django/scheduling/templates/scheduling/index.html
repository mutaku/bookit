		<p class="statement-header">By booking the associated equipment, you are <span class="super-emphasize"> 
        responsible</span> for practicing reasonable care and respect for the instruments.<span class="emphasize">
        Remember,</span> instruments are very expnsive, incredibly time consuming to maintain, and can easily need to be placed offline for repairs for extended duration--months. Do your best to ensure that these instruments remain online and in top condition for everyone in the group. You further acknowledge that disregard for the following guidelines and practices may <span class="super-emphasize">impact future instrument privileges</span>.</p>
		<div class="clause">Cleanliness
			<p>There have been countless issues having to do with cleanliness and respect of equipment. Areas and equipment should be left as you have found them, and all of your experimental material taken with you upon completion. Trash, experimental material, food, etc, should not be left behind for the next person.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="clause">Disk Management
			<p>Please remove your experimental data from equipment computers within a reasonable timeframe. Some leniency for logistical purposes should be expected, but please do not leave TBs of data on the computers as a method of backup. You are responsible for removal, archival, and backup of your own data.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="clause">Issue Reporting
			<p>Be sure to promptly alert an instrument administrator as to any issues, existing or potential. The best way to do so is to sumbit a ticket above. <span class="emphasize">If you have a problem,
            caused, found by, or suspected by you, let someone know immediately</span>. If something is urgent, you can email an instrument administrator directly by clicking the details and status link above and clicking
				<span class="emphasize">contact</span> under the admin listing.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="clause">Instrument Settings and Training
			<p>Before booking and using an instrument, you must first ensure you are properly trained by an adminstrator of that particular instrument. Once trained, only adjust instrument settings that have been explicitly deemed appropriate to adjust during experimental runs. If anything is out of place or non-functional, alert an admininstrator -- do not adjust sensitive instrument settings or calibrations without specific permission to do so.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="clause">Scheduled Time
			<p>Please be respectful of others' need for high-use equipment when booking time on an instrument. If you will be late, no longer able to keep time slot, or running over, please use the calendar to adjust your slot as necessary so that others will be kept aprise of such changes. Be sure to stick to a slot schedule, especially when others are booked after you so as not to impact others' experiments.
